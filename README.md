# Llama 2

We are unlocking the power of large language models. Our latest version of Llama is now accessible to individuals, creators, researchers and businesses of all sizes so that they can experiment, innovate and scale their ideas responsibly. 

This release includes model weights and starting code for pretrained and fine-tuned Llama language models â€” ranging from 7B to 70B parameters.

This repository is intended as a minimal example to load [Llama 2](https://ai.meta.com/research/publications/llama-2-open-foundation-and-fine-tuned-chat-models/) models and run inference. For more detailed examples leveraging HuggingFace, see [llama-recipes](https://github.com/facebookresearch/llama-recipes/).
